# Simple To-Do App

A simple and easy-to-use To-Do application developed with Vue.js. The application allows you to add tasks with deadlines, mark them as done, delete them, and delete all tasks at once. Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Features
